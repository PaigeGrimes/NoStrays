# First, 
go to Settings -> Search for Node and under Languages & Frameworks select Node.js and either 
choose an interpreter if one is already available; otherwise, from the drop down select
download and download the latest version of Node.js.

# Second, 
go to [MongoDB Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) if Mongo is not already
located on your machine. Make sure you download Mongodb server and include Mongodb Compass 
when asked. You will then open Mongodb compass and create a new connection and use the defaults for now.

# Third,
Test that everything works:
in the terminal:

> cd backend

> npm run dev 

> check localhost:5000

> ctr+c to close the server (You could probably run them at the same time since they are on
> different ports but that is up to you)

> cd..

> cd frontend

> npm run dev

> localhost:5173

> ctr+c to close the server
